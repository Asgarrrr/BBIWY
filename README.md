###### Big Brother Is Watching You

**6006** Video surveillance camera just for you.

Some have an administrator connection. For 90% of them, the login / password combination is the factory one. Note that the coordinates have a certain margin of error; also, I did not test all IPs one by one myself, "humanly", an automatic check was done, nothing more.

## About the private life
If you want to have one of the cameras removed from my lists, you just had to think about it before doing shit.

## About IDK what

Many of these shitty cameras use Flash for their web interfaces, others are half-assed, for example for this one below [this shit](http://114.30.139.19:60001/), you don't have a continuous stream but you can use the screen capture, it's a complete camera system.

And other cameras are just really shitty

With some research you can find a way to bypass the often quite old security. For flash, for example for the cameras of the brand `Hi3516`, you can add parameters to the url to take captures every second. For exemple : `http://109.87.157.216:8080/webcapture.jpg?command=snap&channel=1` or for `Defeway`, `http://91.218.19.176:8084/cgi-bin/snapshot.cgi?chn=0&u=admin`.
